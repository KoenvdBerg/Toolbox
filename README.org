* Toolbox Snippet
Small snippet of the full MSc Internship project displaying my current
level of programming.

** Short overview:
The main goal of the project was to create a user command line
interface (CLI) and a graphical user interface (GUI). Only the CLI is
shown here. The original code consisted of 5 modules. Here only a
small portion of the 1st module is shown.

In the file =run_toolbox_CLI.py= this CLI is defined, as
well as a snippet of the main function. It imports the developed
Genbank file parser API from =genbank/genbank.py= to parse the user
provided data into a record list (JSON). Next it imports
=collect_features/load_data.py= to load more datasets (.csv or .xlsx)
and =collect_features/compute_features.py= to mutate an existing
column in the JSON data and add this new feature to the dataset using
the =addNewDatatoRecord()= method.
